Lab 08


To start off I was very confused about this lab so I am pretty sure I may have completed it in the wrong way. But The step I did to complete it is:

start by making a Book class that passes in a abstract property for Title and Author then create a Ibterface called ILibrary that I copied from the lab that has different method that has to be implemented in another class called Library inside the Library class I Has to find a way to implement the methods from the interface that removes the book from the library by Title and a way to return them. Lastly I has to copy another interface called IBag that has another set of methods that had to be implemented into another class called Backpack inside that class I has to implement the method that allows the user to removes book by a index and return them by that index.

I need to find out how to work unit test for this.
